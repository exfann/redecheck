		<description><![CDATA[Hey Eric, Thanks for your comment!

That&#039;s pretty interesting. So, were the happenings more or less the same, or just the locations?
I myself have never once had a recurring dream, to my recollection.

When I was young, my dreams were in the 3rd person, and frankly, a little zany. Now they&#039;re relatively uneventful and I don&#039;t even recall them well enough to tell what perspective they were in.

Well, Eric, you&#039;re the first non-spam commenter on my whole blog, so next time I see you, I owe you your drink of choice! ha ha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adrien,

Interesting post and the topic is of interest to me as well.  I had a series of dreams that repeated for years.  They became so real to me and fixed in my memory that upon entering the dream, I remembered the physical layout of the landscape or the street layouts even though I had never been to any place that resembled it.]]></description>
