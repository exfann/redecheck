# Welcome to ReDeCheck!

ReDeCheck (REsponsive DEsign CHECKer, pronounced “Ready Check”) is an automated tool designed to aid developers during
the process of testing the layouts of responsive (i.e., "mobile ready") web sites. With the huge range of devices
currently available, performing adequate quality assurance on a sufficient range of devices is extremely difficult, if
not impossible. Yet, since it is important to have a high-quality mobile-ready web site, ReDeCheck makes responsive web
testing both efficient and effective!

## Installing Maven

The ReDeCheck project has been implemented using Maven, a build automation tool for projects programmed in the Java
programming language. In order to build the ReDeCheck tool from its source code, then you will first need to install
Maven on your workstation. If you have already installed Maven, then please go directly to the next section. Otherwise,
follow the installation guidelines at https://maven.apache.org/install.html.
